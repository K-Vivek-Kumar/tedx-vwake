        Humans have been kicking around a pale blue dot in space for a while
        now. The rise and fall, the ups and downs, and the meandering turns
        humankind has taken have been painted and weaved onto the tapestry - our
        legacy and the proof of our existence in an otherwise unchanging and
        indifferent universe. People spanning cultures, eras, nationalities, and
        backgrounds have contributed to compiling the saga of all time. This
        saga has been visualized, part by part, and time-to-time in tapestries.
        Join us as we weave together the tapestry of the lives, the ideas, and
        the revolutions made by transient individuals to make an immortal and
        magnificent representation of humanity: Humanity's Tapestry.
